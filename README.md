# Nimbus 1337 - CloudWalk Challenge

An interactive challenge website created for the "AI Shapeshifter - Transform Any Role Through AI" position at CloudWalk.

## About the Project

Nimbus 1337 is an interactive experience inspired by Cicada 3301-type challenges, where participants need to solve enigmas using artificial intelligence as their main tool.

The site features a terminal/matrix aesthetic with a black background and green text, creating an immersive technological atmosphere.

## Challenge Structure

The challenge consists of three progressive enigmas:

1. **Enigma 1: Decode the Message** - A binary encoded message that needs to be deciphered.
2. **Enigma 2: Creative Solution** - Transaction data analysis to identify fraud.

Upon completing all enigmas, the participant gains access to a special application form.
